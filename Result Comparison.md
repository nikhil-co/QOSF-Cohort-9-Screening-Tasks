# Result Comparison

Results from both the approaches are *similar* as both gives us correct independent set for the graphs. But the runtime for analog based QAOA is higher compared to gate based (digital quantum computing) approach. This is mostly due to fact that there is an extra simulation cost (on classical computers) associated with analog QC. In digital quantum computing, to simulate a quantum circuit we need to keep track of $2^N$ (for $N$ qubits) complex numbers, but that is not the case in analog approach as one has to simulate the physical aspect of a praticular architecture (neutral atoms in our case). QAOA inspired from the adiabatic algorithm is more fit to run on an analog quantum computer than a gate bases quantum computer.

It is evident from the state histogram that there is a distinct separation of solution the bit-strings in analog approach compared to the gate based approach. This hold for lower numbers of layers as I used 4 layers for analog approach and varied the number of layers for the digital approach. However, we can see that analog QAOA struggles to find the correct set for the graph $G7$, whereas gate based QAOA gives the correct set with a single layer less ($3$ compared to $4$) than analog QAOA. Both approaches have their own place in the quantum computing world.
